# Talk Proposal: PieData

## General

### Submission Title

PieData - Text Mining on Cake Recipes

### Submission Type

Talk (30 min.)

### Abstract

This talk summarizes a text mining project applied to 40,000 cake recipes. The focus lies on generating numerical embeddings from ingredients and recipe instructions and applying supervised learning to predict the cake ratings on a five point scale.

### Description

Everbody enjoys a good slice of delicious cake. But what is it that makes cakes objectively delicious? Is the extra piece of butter you put in the dough? Or maybe because you mixed wet and dry ingredients seperately? In this talk we will go on a text mining journey harnessing more than 40,000 cake recipes from a large German recipe platform to truely understand what makes a good cake.

1. Structure of the data source and brief description of retrieval and storage process.
2. Normalizing the data.
3. Applying word embeddings.
4. Training a classifier.
5. Benchmark results.
6. Use case results.

The presentation will start by introducing the data source, explaining the retrievel process and presenting some descriptive statistics. Next, it will explain how natural language processing tools like topic modelling can be used to convert recipes into numerical embeddings. Finally, a regression model will be trained on the numerical embeddings trying to predict the rating the cake received on the platform. If time allows, we will also go more into depth with determining similarities between ingredients and building a ingredient graph.

This talk demonstrates how NLP can be used to analyze unstructured datasets. It does so by introducing the audience to a entertaining, easy to understand and delicious use case.
