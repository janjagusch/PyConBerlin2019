# Talk Proposal: PieData

## General

### Submission Title

PieData - Text Mining on Cake Recipes

### Submission Type

Talk (30 min.)

### Abstract

This talk summarizes a text mining project applied to 40,000 cake recipes from chefkoch.de. The focus lies on generating numerical embeddings from ingredients and recipe instructions and applying supervised learning to predict the cake ratings on a five point scale.

### Description

Everbody enjoys a slice of delicious cake. But how does one prepare good cakes? And how can you avoid your freshly baked pie to be too dry, dense or burnt? In this talk, we will use Python and Scikit-Learn to analyze more than 40,000 recipes and the corresponding user ratings from a large German recipe platform (chefkoch.de) and learn how to bake objectively delicious cakes. During the presentation, you will be introduced to all steps involved in this text mining project:

1. Sourcing and describing the data.  
2. Cleaning and normalizing the text.  
3. Converting text into meaningful topics.  
4. Engineering and selecting features.  
5. Fitting a regression model to the average user rating.  
6. Evaluating the results.

You will learn about general natural language processing tools, such as term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency and singular value decomposition. Furthermore, you will see how to integrate these components into a single machine learning pipeline, using scikit-learn.

### Notes for reviewers only

- The data was extracted from chefkoch.de, using a scraper written in Python. This means that the raw data is mostly in German. However, all necessary information for this talk will be translated to English.
- I checked chefkoch.de's terms and conditions (AGB), which does not specify whether data can be scraped and/ or shared with others. I am no expert on this subject, but I believe that scraping and sharing for a non-profit, educational purpose lies within their AGBs. I have also attached a copy of their AGBs from June 2019.
- I will share code and (probably) also data to make this project fully reproducible.
