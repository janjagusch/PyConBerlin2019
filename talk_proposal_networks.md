## General

### Submission Title

Visualizing Networks in Python

### Submission Type

Talk (30 min.)

### Abstract

This talk explains how to visualize workflow-, social- and neural- networks in Python. It demonstrates how to use established frameworks to build graph-like objects, calculate topologies and render static as well as interactive plots.

### Description

What does your company's order-to-ship process, your friends on social media and your trained deep learning model have in common? In fact, all of them are networks of some sort! As network data seems to become increasingly more important, why not learn how to produce some impressive network visualizations in Python?

In this talk, you will learn:

1. How to use networkx to convert your data into graph objects.
2. How to calculate network layouts and build your own custom topology methods.
3. How to represent your attribute's of your data in certrain characteristics of the network (node size, edge width, facecolor, opacity, shape).
4. How to use matplotlib to render beautiful static documents.
5. How to use bokeh to produce exiting interactive animations.

At the end of the presentation, you will be able to generate insightful and gorgeous network visualizations that you can impress your colleague, supervisor, client or investor with.

### Notes for reviewers only

- Some time ago, I built a small project to help me visualize Keras models. I haven't touched it in a while but I already delivered some nice visualizations. You can find that repository here: https://github.com/janjagusch/neural_network_visualizer.
- Very recently, I developed an algorithm for my company that visualizes the similarity between skills (the kind of skills you can find on professional social networks). You can find an example of that kind of visualization here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTilvB6LdiP3tBtTmHlpOwKTsXDQ6jPO/view?usp=sharing.
- Last year, I build a little something to visualize workflows. You can find another example here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janjagusch/celonis-case-study/master/plots/1_process.png?token=AGFHV3QLQ3XABYIR2UODBFS467TIY
- For this presentation, my goal is to merge all these projects and convert them to one big tutorial.
